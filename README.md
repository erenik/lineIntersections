# lineIntersections

Small C# project where you draw lines where lines may not intersect.

- You can click and drag lines, or click at two places to create lines.
- There's also two buttons - one to generate a bunch of lines for performance testing, and a button to clear the canvas/lines and restart.
- Two labels are visible - one for the # of lines on the canvas, and one for the intersection calculation time to measure performance.
