# lineIntersections

Small C# project where you draw lines where lines may not intersect.

- Click once to start drawing a line, click a second time to stop drawing.
- Lines may not intersect, which is visualized by green and red colors while drawing the line.
- There's a button to clear the canvas and restart.
- There are three labels:
  - Number of lines on the canvas,
  - Number of line-segments in all lines on the canvas
  - Intersection calculation time to measure performance.
